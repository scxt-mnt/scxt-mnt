# Yo ðŸ‘‹

I'm just someone who enjoys building things on the web and messing around with games and engines.  
Mostly a fullstack web dev, sometimes a game dev, and occasionally working on my own engine.

Learning every day.  
Shipping when it feels right.  
Always tweaking something under the hood.
